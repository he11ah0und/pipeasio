# Changelog

All notable changes to PipeASIO are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Settings panel: the Monitor tab and the device combos now follow a live
  PipeWire graph model (`PipeWireGraph`) instead of polling `pw-dump` /
  `pw-top` subprocesses - connections, device hotplug and DSP stats update
  event-driven.  The graph logic (`GraphModel`) is PipeWire-free and covered
  by headless tests that replay recorded registry/node/profiler events.
- Editable ASIO ControlPanel: the host's control-panel button hands off to
  the native `pipeasio-settings` when launchable (spawned directly by the
  driver's unix side) and falls back to a built-in Win32 dialog (Settings +
  About tabs) otherwise, e.g. inside bwrap sandboxes.  The dialog and the Qt
  panel watch the config and reload on external changes.
- `buffer_mode` config key (0 Free / 1 Fixed / 3 Wireless), superseding the
  `fixed_buffer_size` / `follow_device_clock` booleans; Wireless follows the
  target device's quantum (Bluetooth).
- The settings panel shows the build identifier in the window title and the
  About tab, and exposes `rt_priority` and `buffer_mode` controls.
- Virtual audio devices (e.g. `easyeffects_source` and other nodes without
  a hardware device behind them) are now valid auto-connect targets: their
  monitor ports are matched as sources, so effects chains and virtual mics
  can feed the driver's inputs.  The panel lists `Audio/*/Virtual` devices
  in the device combos too.
- `rt_priority` config key: the `SCHED_FIFO` priority requested for the
  driver's real-time data thread (default 15, range 1-80, INI only - no
  environment override). In the 32-bit WoW64 build the key is accepted but
  has no effect; the unixlib's data loop runs on PipeWire's thread-utils
  and the RT bridge only exists in the native driver.
- The driver logs a build identifier (build number + git hash + `-dirty`
  marker) once when its module loads, so even a failed startup shows which
  binary was loaded; `build_info.h` is generated at configure time and
  regenerated when the git state moves, so fresh build trees compile
  without ordering tricks.
- `pipeasio_config_save()`: a single atomic (tmp+rename) writer for the
  panel's INI format in the driver core, with a save/load roundtrip unit
  test. The settings panel and the ASIO ControlPanel switch to it in a
  follow-up.

### Changed

- RT-safety and polling fixes in the driver core, and a deduplication
  pass that removes dead code (net fewer lines in the core).
- The filter node no longer sets `PW_KEY_NODE_GROUP` to `group.dsp.0`.

### Fixed

- WoW64 link: the `PAU_SET_RT_PRIORITY` call is now part of the unixlib
  thunk table, so `pipeasio32` builds again.

- `pipeasio-register` failed with `regsvr32 failed (status 3)` on runner
  builds where `bin/wine` is the 32-bit loader (kron4ek, proton
  derivatives — the usual Bottles runners): the 32-bit `regsvr32` cannot
  `LoadLibrary` the 64-bit `pipeasio64.dll`
  ([#9](https://github.com/M0n7y5/pipeasio/issues/9)).  The script now
  prefers `wine64` when it exists and falls back to `wine` otherwise.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Distro build matrix for toolchain drift that host-only CI misses.
  Locally, `tests/distro/run.sh` builds Fedora, Ubuntu, and Arch inside
  distrobox with each distro's package-build CFLAGS/LDFLAGS (Fedora RPM
  `%{optflags}` including `-flto=auto`, Ubuntu `dpkg-buildflags` with
  `hardening=+all`, Arch `makepkg.conf`); the Fedora leg asserts `-flto`
  is present so the issue #6 regression case stays covered. CI runs the
  same Fedora and Ubuntu legs via `build-distros` (Arch is already covered
  by the existing jobs).

### Fixed

- Building with distro-injected LTO CFLAGS (e.g. Fedora RPM's `-flto=auto`)
  failed at the winegcc link with `pipeasio.dll.spec:1: function
  'DllRegisterServer' not defined`
  ([#6](https://github.com/M0n7y5/pipeasio/issues/6)): winebuild's `ld -r`
  partial link leaves the `.spec` exports undefined in LTO objects even when
  `nm` still shows them on the individual `.o` files. Object libraries that
  feed winebuild/winegcc (the driver DLL and the WoW64 unixlib) now compile
  with `-fno-lto`.
- Debian/Ubuntu Wine SDK headers under the nested
  `/usr/include/wine/wine/windows` layout (from `libwine-dev`) are now found
  by `cmake/WineDLL.cmake`, so the driver configures and builds against
  distro Wine packages without a manual `-DWINE_INCLUDE_DIRS=...`.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- RT thread priority no longer preempts the PipeWire graph driver
  ([#4](https://github.com/M0n7y5/pipeasio/issues/4)): the default
  `SCHED_FIFO` priority applied to the driver's process thread (and the
  32-bit WoW64 pump) dropped from 77/80 to 15. On stock desktops (the common
  case), RTKit caps the daemon's data loop at priority 20, so 77/80 could
  preempt it and starve the audio server whenever other streams were active,
  causing system-wide xruns, pops, and DAW CPU meter spikes that persisted
  until the driver was reloaded; PAM-rtprio setups where the daemon runs at 88
  had no priority inversion.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- The Wine integration probes (`asio_probe`, the PipeWire delivery/filter
  probes) now run under CTest alongside the Linux-native unit tests, so
  `ctest --test-dir build` drives the whole suite - including the run that
  gates every tagged release.

### Fixed

- The real-time audio thread ran at normal scheduling priority (`SCHED_OTHER`)
  on stock installs, causing xruns under any CPU load. PipeWire's data loop
  requests the "configured default" RT priority, which the thread-utils bridge
  treated as a no-op - and since that bridge bypasses module-rt/RTKit, nothing
  else promoted the thread either. The default request now maps to a real
  `SCHED_FIFO` priority (77, below the PipeWire daemon's data loop at 88), and
  on `EPERM` retries clamped to `RLIMIT_RTPRIO`. The thread driving the whole
  ASIO `bufferSwitch` chain now actually runs FIFO.
- Every `audio_open` leaked one zombie thread and its stack: the context's
  initial data loop was stopped through the Wine thread-utils bridge installed
  *after* the loop had started, so the original pthread was never joined. The
  loop is now stopped and joined through the utils that created it before the
  bridge is installed.
- Use-after-free when an ASIO host services `kAsioResetRequest` synchronously
  on the config-watcher thread and releases the driver from inside the
  notification: the watcher's state now lives in a refcounted heap context
  owned jointly by the driver and the thread, the only call-out is wrapped in
  `AddRef`/`Release`, and a same-thread stop orphans the context instead of
  waiting on itself. A synchronous `DisposeBuffers`/`CreateBuffers` reset no
  longer leaves two watchers racing the staged config or leaks the old
  thread's handles.
- The real-time output copy (and the silence paths) wrote a full host period
  into the PipeWire buffer with no capacity check, overrunning the mapping
  every cycle when the graph clamps the quantum below the host buffer size
  (`clock.quantum-limit`). Output and silence writes are now clamped to the
  dequeued buffer's capacity, mirroring the existing input-side clamp, in both
  the 64-bit and WoW64 paths.
- The 64-bit sample position wrapped every ~25 hours at 48 kHz again: on the
  wine64 ELF build `ULONG` is 32-bit but `ULONG_MAX` is 2^64-1, so the hi-word
  carry in the buffer-switch path never fired. The counters are now stored as
  atomic 64-bit values and split into the ASIO hi/lo wire format only at the
  edges, which also fixes a torn read of the position that raced the real-time
  writer.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- The Monitor tab now shows the **Output device** and **Input device** the
  driver's ports are currently connected to - the live sink and source resolved
  from the PipeWire graph - so it is obvious which hardware the driver is
  feeding, especially when autoconnect or "follow default" picks the device.
  Each row also reports the device's negotiated format (rate, channels, sample
  format), its state, and the Bluetooth codec when applicable (e.g. aptX), and
  sits below the live State row.
- New **About** tab in the settings panel with the version, a short description,
  and links to the website and documentation, the GitHub repository, the issue
  tracker, and a Ko-fi support link.

### Changed

- Live config reload now diffs the INI before resetting. Saving the settings
  panel re-negotiates the audio graph only when a reset-worthy field actually
  changed, so a no-op save (or one that merely rewrites the file) no longer
  causes a dropout. Buffer size, sample rate, device selection, follow-device
  clock, and autoconnect now take effect on the reset itself - the new PipeWire
  quantum applies even when the host only re-creates buffers instead of fully
  re-initializing the driver, which previously left buffer-size changes silently
  unapplied. Channel-count and node-name changes are detected and logged as
  needing a driver reselect, since those ports are allocated at init.

### Fixed

- Deadlock when an ASIO host services `kAsioResetRequest` synchronously on the
  config-watcher thread: the watcher teardown no longer waits on itself - it
  signals stop and lets the COM-thread `DisposeBuffers`/`Release` path reap the
  thread and event handles.
- Data races on the driver run-state and the host-callback pointer, which the
  config-watcher and the real-time process callback read while the COM thread
  wrote them; both are now atomic.
- Real-time input copy could read past a PipeWire capture buffer smaller than
  the host period (graph quantum below the configured buffer size). The input
  gather is now clamped to the mapped buffer and the tail zero-filled, mirroring
  the existing output-side clamp; both the 64-bit and WoW64 paths are fixed.
- The experimental 32-bit WoW64 PE front end no longer fails to link. The input
  clamp above calls `audio_port_buffer_avail_frames`, which is unix-side only; the
  PE half (which links the WoW64 proxy instead of `audio.c`) now carries a matching
  stub, since that gather actually runs unix-side. `-DBUILD_WOW64_32=ON` builds
  again, with 32-bit load + streaming re-verified through `asio_probe32` and
  VB-Audio's VBASIOTest32.
- 32-bit (WoW64) autoconnect linked nothing to hardware: `wow64_port_register`
  never handed the PE side a token for the freshly registered port, so the
  proxy returned a NULL handle and `audio_port_name()` came back empty - the
  link factory then could not resolve our own ports (`node=4294967295`,
  `pw_port_id=0`) even though the device ports resolved. The handler now assigns
  the out-token (like `wow64_port_by_name` already did); our input/output ports
  resolve and link to the selected source/sink. Streaming was unaffected (it
  runs unix-side), so the regression only showed as silent autoconnect.
- 32-bit (WoW64) live config reload was always disabled. The watcher resolved
  the INI path with the PE-side `pipeasio_config_path()`, whose `getenv()`
  cannot see `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`$HOME` in the Windows environment under Wine,
  so it logged "cannot resolve config path" and returned before reaching the
  unixlib fingerprint poll it already carried. It now skips the PE-side lookup
  in the WoW64 build and detects edits through
  `pipeasio_wow64_config_fingerprint()`, so saving the panel re-applies live in
  32-bit hosts too.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Experimental opt-in 32-bit (WoW64) front end for 32-bit Windows ASIO hosts,
  built with `-DBUILD_WOW64_32=ON` (default OFF) and a MinGW cross-compiler. A
  thin i386 PE thunk (`pipeasio32.dll`) forwards every ASIO call over
  `__wine_unix_call` to the same 64-bit PipeWire backend (`pipeasio32.so`), so no
  32-bit libpipewire or 32-bit Linux userspace is needed. `pipeasio-register`
  registers the CLSID under the 32-bit view when the DLL is present. The 64-bit
  driver is byte-for-byte unaffected. Validated end-to-end by a new `asio_probe32`
  host, with the WoW64 unix-call ABI layout locked by a compile-time test.

- The WoW64 DSP pump thread runs at `SCHED_FIFO` priority 80 (matching the native
  driver's RT ceiling) with FTZ/DAZ denormal flushing and an 8 MB stack, and its
  per-cycle reply deadline uses `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, so the 32-bit path sustains
  64-128 frame buffers without xruns.

- Prebuilt Arch/CachyOS x86_64 binaries (the 64-bit driver plus the opt-in
  32-bit WoW64 front end) attached to each tagged GitHub release, labeled with
  the exact Wine, glibc, and PipeWire versions they were built against. CI now
  also builds the 32-bit WoW64 path.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- CI on GitHub Actions: every push and pull request builds the driver and
  panel and runs the Linux-native test suite on Arch Linux.
- The integration probe now verifies that the sample position advances during
  the run and that the timecode `Future` selectors are denied.
- `tests/asio_loopback`: a digital loopback analyzer (RTL-Utility/RMAA
  equivalent for a converter-less driver). It plays a per-channel frame
  counter through the driver and a PipeWire null-sink loopback and fails on
  any non-bit-exact sample, dropped or duplicated buffer, swapped channel, or
  measured round-trip latency disagreeing with `GetLatencies()`; `SWEEP=1`
  covers buffer sizes 128-1024 at 44.1/48/96 kHz with in-process buffer
  re-negotiation.

### Changed

- Relicensed the entire project under GPL-3.0-or-later, replacing the previous
  split of LGPL-2.1-or-later (driver) and GPL-2.0-or-later (settings panel). The
  separate `COPYING.LIB` / `COPYING.GUI` files are now a single `COPYING` (the
  GPLv3 text). The original WineASIO authors' copyright notices are retained; the
  relicensing uses the "or later" upgrade path (and LGPL 2.1 section 3) that
  those licenses already grant.

### Removed

- Fake ASIO timecode support. The driver no longer answers `kAsioCanTimeCode`
  / `kAsioEnableTimeCodeRead` affirmatively or fills `ASIOTime.timeCode` with
  fabricated values - PipeWire has no transport timeline to source timecode
  from. Hosts fall back to sample-position sync, which is accurate.

### Fixed

- `GetSamplePosition` returned only the low 32 bits of the sample counter,
  wrapping to zero after about 25 hours at 48 kHz; it now reports the full
  64-bit position.
- `regsvr32 /u` now actually removes the driver's registry keys. Unregistration
  deleted keys through a handle opened without `DELETE` access, so every delete
  failed and the CLSID and `Software\ASIO\PipeASIO` entries were left behind;
  the recursive delete is now `RegDeleteTree`, and unregistering an already
  unregistered driver succeeds.
- Driver registration and unregistration now report real failures: raw win32
  error codes were previously returned where COM HRESULTs are expected, so
  errors like access-denied counted as success.
- The Wine test hosts (`asio_probe`, `asio_loopback`) parse their command line
  themselves: current Wine's CRT startup delivers `argc=0` to `main()`, so the
  probe's seconds argument was silently ignored.

## [1.0.0-rc1] - 2026-06-08

First PipeASIO release. Forked from WineASIO and reworked to talk to PipeWire
directly through `libpipewire-0.3`, with no `libjack.so.0` runtime dependency, so
the driver loads inside the Steam Runtime container that Proton uses.

### Added

- Native C++/Qt6 settings panel (`pipeasio-settings`) with a Settings tab and a
  live Monitor tab, replacing the old PyQt GUI.
- Monitor tab showing live PipeWire quantum, sample rate, DSP load, xruns, and
  state, auto-discovering the driver's own PipeWire node.
- DSP load drawn as a rolling history graph (color coded by level, current value
  shown, dimmed when idle) instead of a single bar.
- "Follow device clock" option (`follow_device_clock`) so output to a Bluetooth
  sink works, where the sink's clock cannot be slaved to the host.
- PipeWire sink and source selection (`output_device` / `input_device`), honored
  by autoconnect; an empty value follows the PipeWire default.
- `sample_rate` setting: `0` follows the graph rate, a non-zero value pins it.
- Tooltips on every Settings and Monitor field.
- Subnormal float flushing (FTZ/DAZ) on the audio thread to avoid rare CPU stalls
  and the dropouts they cause.
- ASIO host timestamp derived from the PipeWire graph clock rather than the
  system tick count.

### Changed

- Configuration moved from the Windows registry to a flat INI file at
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipeasio/config.ini`. The driver re-reads it while running, so
  saving in the panel applies within about a second with no host restart, and the
  file is written atomically.
- Default channel count is now 2 in / 2 out (was 16 / 16) for a smaller default
  graph; raise it in the panel as needed.
- "Follow default" connects to the actual PipeWire default sink and source read
  from the default metadata, rather than the first device discovered.
- The panel's confirm button is now "Apply": it saves without closing, so each
  change can be heard live.
- The panel keeps a saved device or sample rate that is currently unavailable,
  marked "(unavailable)", instead of resetting it on Apply.
- The in-app ASIO control-panel button now points you to run `pipeasio-settings`
  on the host, since the Qt panel cannot run inside the Wine/Proton container.
- Removed the obsolete "Autostart server" option.

### Fixed

- Crash (use-after-free and heap corruption) when a PipeWire device connects or
  disconnects while the driver is starting or reconnecting. Device-discovery
  caches are now locked against the registry thread, and port-name lists are
  copied before use.
- Garbled or out-of-bounds output when following a device clock or when PipeWire
  clamps the forced quantum; the driver no longer publishes more audio per cycle
  than it produced.
- Slow or pitched-down playback at buffer sizes other than the backend default;
  `CreateBuffers()` now always syncs the negotiated size to the PipeWire quantum.
- Memory leak when the audio backend failed to start during buffer setup, and
  leaked discovered-port lists on the driver-init error paths.
- The settings panel no longer freezes on Monitor refresh; `pw-top` and `pw-dump`
  now run asynchronously off the UI thread.
- The Monitor tab now populates while audio plays. It previously failed to
  recognize the driver's node, read an all-zero baseline sample, and mishandled
  locale comma decimals.
- Hardened channel-count limits from both the INI and the environment overrides,
  and tightened COM teardown and several NULL and error paths.
