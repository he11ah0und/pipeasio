# PipeASIO

PipeASIO is an ASIO driver for Wine that talks to PipeWire directly — no `libjack.so.0` runtime dependency.

It's a fork of [WineASIO](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio), created so the driver loads cleanly inside the Steam Runtime `steamrt4` container that FL Studio runs in under Faugus / Proton-CachyOS — that container ships `libpipewire-0.3` but not `libjack.so.0`, which makes upstream WineASIO SEGV on `dlopen`.

PipeASIO has its own distinct COM identity — CLSID `{2D3CA9E2-1193-4C5D-B5FD-38798F3DC074}`, ASIO registration under `HKCU\Software\ASIO\PipeASIO`, DLL filename `pipeasio64.dll`. Installing PipeASIO alongside WineASIO is safe; neither overrides the other, and hosts (FL Studio etc.) see them as separate ASIO drivers.

ASIO is the most common Windows low-latency driver, so is commonly used in audio workstation programs like FL Studio, Ableton Live, and Reaper.

### BUILDING

This fork uses CMake. x86_64 only.

Build requirements: `cmake` (≥ 3.20), `ninja-build` (recommended) or GNU make,
`gcc`, Wine SDK (`wine-devel` / `winehq-stable-dev`), `pkg-config`, and
`libpipewire-0.3-dev`.  The optional Qt6 settings panel additionally needs a
C++ compiler and `qt6-base-dev` (Qt6 Widgets); it builds by default when those
are present and is skipped otherwise (`-DBUILD_SETTINGS_PANEL=OFF` to force off).

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

Debug build with assertions and Wine debug channel macros:

```sh
cmake -B build-debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build-debug
```

### INSTALLING

System-wide (matches the distro Wine layout most ASIO hosts use):

```sh
sudo cmake --install build --prefix /usr
```

User-local (no `sudo`, sandboxed under `$HOME` — required for Proton /
Faugus / Steam, see below):

```sh
cmake --install build --prefix "$HOME/.local"
```

Either lays down:

```
<prefix>/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/pipeasio64.dll
<prefix>/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/pipeasio.dll    -> pipeasio64.dll
<prefix>/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/pipeasio64.dll.so
<prefix>/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/pipeasio.dll.so    -> pipeasio64.dll.so
```

The `pipeasio.dll{,.so}` symlinks satisfy the unified PE name that Wine 10+
expects; without them `regsvr32 pipeasio64.dll` fails with status `c0000135`
on newer Wine.

**NOTE:** Wine library directories vary across distros — adjust `--prefix`
or override `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` if your distro is non-standard.

### DEVELOPMENT (VS Code)

Recommended extensions are listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`; VS Code
prompts on first open. The build emits `build/compile_commands.json` for
clangd; the in-tree `.clang-format` and `.editorconfig` keep diffs clean.

#### EXTRAS

For user convenience a `pipeasio-register` script is included in this repo, if you are packaging PipeASIO consider installing it as part of PipeASIO.

Additionally a native settings panel (`pipeasio-settings`, C++/Qt6 Widgets) is
built from this repository's `gui` subdir and installed to `bin`.  Run it from a
terminal on your Linux host; the in-app ASIO "control panel" button shows a
message pointing here, because the Qt panel cannot run inside the Wine/Proton
container the host loads the driver into.  It needs Qt6 Widgets at build time;
pass `-DBUILD_SETTINGS_PANEL=OFF` to skip it.

### REGISTERING

After building and installing PipeASIO, we still need to register it on each Wine prefix.  
For your convenience a script is provided on this repository, so you can simply run:

```sh
pipeasio-register
```

to activate PipeASIO for the current Wine prefix.

#### CUSTOM WINEPREFIX

The `pipeasio-register` script will register the PipeASIO driver in the default Wine prefix `~/.wine`.  
You can specify another prefix like so:

```sh
env WINEPREFIX="$HOME/asioapp" pipeasio-register
```

`pipeasio-register` searches for the install root in this order:
`$PIPEASIO_PREFIX/lib/wine` → `$HOME/.local/lib/wine` → `/usr/lib/wine`
→ distro variants → `/opt/wine-{devel,stable,staging}`. Set
`PIPEASIO_PREFIX` to point it at a non-standard prefix.

#### PROTON / STEAM / FAUGUS

Proton runs Wine inside a pressure-vessel container (steamrt4). The
container does **not** expose the host's `/usr/lib/wine/`, so a
system-wide install is invisible to Proton's Wine. Two things make
PipeASIO work inside Proton:

1. Install PipeASIO under `$HOME` (pressure-vessel exposes the user's
   home directory by default):

   ```sh
   cmake --install build --prefix "$HOME/.local"
   ```

2. Set `WINEDLLPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/wine` in the launcher's per-game
   environment so Proton's Wine finds the ELF `.so` half. Proton has
   honored a host-provided `WINEDLLPATH` since
   [PR #9420](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/pull/9420);
   Proton-CachyOS ships this fix.

   In **Faugus-launcher**, put it in the per-game "Launch options"
   environment field:

   ```
   WINEDLLPATH=/home/<you>/.local/lib/wine
   ```

   (Use the absolute path — Faugus doesn't expand `~` or `$HOME` in
   that field.)

Then register PipeASIO in the Proton wineprefix as usual:

```sh
env WINEPREFIX="$HOME/Faugus/<game>" pipeasio-register
```

The PE stub lands in `<prefix>/drive_c/windows/system32/` and the
CLSID registration persists in the wineprefix's registry, both shared
across Wine versions.

### GENERAL INFORMATION

PipeASIO talks to PipeWire 1.6+ natively via `libpipewire-0.3`. The graph
quantum is locked to the ASIO host's negotiated buffer size via
`PW_KEY_NODE_FORCE_QUANTUM`; the sample rate follows the graph unless pinned
(see `sample_rate`), in which case `PW_KEY_NODE_FORCE_RATE` is set.

PipeASIO is configured by a flat INI file at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pipeasio/config.ini` (fallback `~/.config/pipeasio/config.ini`).
The driver reads it natively at startup; the settings panel writes it.  Every
option can also be overridden by an environment variable.  A missing file means
built-in defaults, and unknown keys are ignored.  The file has a single
`[pipeasio]` section:

#### inputs / outputs
Number of PipeWire DSP ports PipeASIO opens.  Defaults 16 / 16.
Env: `PIPEASIO_NUMBER_INPUTS`, `PIPEASIO_NUMBER_OUTPUTS`.

#### auto_connect
Defaults to 1: PipeASIO connects its channels to a hardware device on start.
Set to 0 to leave the node unconnected and patch it yourself in a PipeWire
patchbay.  Env: `PIPEASIO_CONNECT_TO_HARDWARE` (`on`/`off`).

#### output_device / input_device
The PipeWire `node.name` of the sink (output) and source (input) to
auto-connect to.  Empty (the default) means the first available device.
Env: `PIPEASIO_OUTPUT_DEVICE`, `PIPEASIO_INPUT_DEVICE`.

#### sample_rate
`0` (default) follows the PipeWire graph rate; a non-zero value pins the rate
via `PW_KEY_NODE_FORCE_RATE`.  Env: `PIPEASIO_SAMPLE_RATE`.

#### fixed_buffer_size
Defaults to 1: the buffer size is controlled by PipeWire and the ASIO host
cannot change it.  Set to 0 to let the host change PipeWire's quantum (via
`PW_KEY_NODE_FORCE_QUANTUM`) in `CreateBuffers()`.
Env: `PIPEASIO_FIXED_BUFFERSIZE` (`on`/`off`).

#### buffer_size
The preferred size returned by `GetBufferSize()` (see the ASIO docs).  Must be
a power of two within [16, 8192] (`PIPEASIO_MINIMUM_BUFFERSIZE` /
`PIPEASIO_MAXIMUM_BUFFERSIZE` in the source); out-of-range values fall back to
1024.  Env: `PIPEASIO_PREFERRED_BUFFERSIZE`.

Be careful: a size the hardware doesn't support makes PipeWire reject the
request or insert resampling — either way you may get xruns.

#### node_name
Overrides the PipeWire client/node name (otherwise derived from the host
program name).  Env: `PIPEASIO_CLIENT_NAME`.
